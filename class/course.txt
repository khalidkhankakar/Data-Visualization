Distribution
Structure of the data, Behaviour of data, 

Kinds of Distribution
    1. Discrete Distribution
        A variable which can be only counted. whole numbers, countable. like humans

    2. Continous Distribution
        A variable which can be measure. like temprature, weight

1. Bionomial Distribution
This type of Discrete Distribution. Bionomial experiment Data in which we put the Bionomial Distribution.
    1. It has two possible outcomes.
    2. Trails are independant.
    3. Probability of success remain constant.
    4. Experiment may be fitted to fixed numbers trails.
Formula
    P(X= x) = (nCx).(p^x).[q]^(n-x)
    q = n-P
    P	=	binomial probability
    x	=	number of times for a specific outcome within n trials
    p	=	probability of success on a single trial
    q	=	probability of failure on a single trial
    n	=	number of trials

(nCx)
    nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)

2. Poisson Distribution
Draws from Poisson process
Number of trails are more but probability of success is very low

Accidently occurs

P(x=x) = (e^u)(u^x) / x

n -> inf
p -> 0

3. Hypergeometric Distribution
probability of success doesn't remain constant
Sample without replacement. 
Population reduces



N = Population
n = sample
x = number of freq

formula = P(X = x) =  (kCx) * (N-kCn-x) / (Nn)

Experiment maybe repeated n times
Probability of success remains same


Normal Distribution
two parameters
mu
mean
